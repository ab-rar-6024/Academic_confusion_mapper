🧠 Academic Confusion Mapper
Detect Where a Student Is Confused — and Explain It Clearly

An AI-powered hybrid educational assistant that identifies specific conceptual confusion in student input and generates structured, technically accurate explanations with visual learning support.

🚀 Project Overview

Academic Confusion Mapper is a hybrid Natural Language Understanding (NLU) system designed to:

Detect the concept a student understands

Identify the exact confusion node

Classify the knowledge gap type

Generate structured explanations

Provide visual learning demonstrations

Unlike pure LLM systems, this project uses a hybrid architecture combining structured domain knowledge with controlled AI generation to ensure accuracy and prevent hallucination.

🧠 Example Input
I understand gradient descent but not why learning rate affects convergence

🔍 System Output
✅ Concept Understood

gradient descent

❓ Confusion Node

why learning rate affects convergence

📚 Knowledge Gap Type

Application confusion

📘 Explanation

Simple Explanation

Deeper Technical Explanation

Real-world Analogy

📊 Visual Demonstration

Loss curve visualization

Small learning rate (stable convergence)

Large learning rate (overshooting behavior)

🏗 Architecture
Hybrid Design (College Demo Optimized)

The system avoids pure LLM hallucination by using:

🔹 Rule-based structured explanations (core accuracy)

🔹 LLM-based analogy generation (intelligent enhancement)

🔹 Mathematical visualization using Matplotlib

🔹 Zero-shot classification for knowledge gap detection

⚙️ Tech Stack

Python

Streamlit

HuggingFace Transformers (FLAN-T5)

PyTorch
